# Hello, Real-Time World!

The transpilation tool, in addition to performing code translation, is used to create new Termina projects. Thus, the tool supports different commands. In particular, the `new` command allows you to create a new project containing an initial directory tree and a project configuration file with default parameters.

In our case, we are going to create a new project named `hello_world`. To do this, we will execute the following command from the terminal:

```bash
$ termina new hello_world
```

After executing the command, a new directory called `hello_world` containing the following elements will have been generated:

```
hello_world
    termina.yaml
    app/app.fin
    src
    output
```

The file `termina.yaml` stores the project configuration parameters. The `app` directory contains the main Termina source code file of the application. By default, this file is named `app.fin`. The `src` directory will contain the additional modules that are part of the project. In our case, we will not add any files to this directory. The `output` directory will store the files generated by the transpiler from the Termina code.

Next, we are going to modify the `app.fin` file, adding the following content:

```termina
task class HelloWorldClass {

    timer_port : sink TimeVal triggers timeout;

    system_port : access SystemAPI;

    action timeout(&priv self, _current_time : TimeVal) -> Status<i32> {

        let msg : [char; 128] = "Hello, Real-Time World!";
        let ret : Status<i32> = Success;

        self->system_port.println(128, &msg);

        return ret;

    }

};

emitter timer : PeriodicTimer = {
    period = {
        tv_sec = 1,
        tv_usec = 0
    }
};

#[priority(10)]
task hello_world_task : HelloWorldClass = {

    timer_port <- timer,
    system_port <-> system_entry

};
```

The next step is to update the `termina.yaml` configuration file, where we will need to add the following line at the end:

```yaml
enable-system-port: true
```

Finally, we will generate the application code with the following commands:

```bash
$ termina build
```

If the command has been executed successfully, the `output` directory should contain the modules resulting from the transpilation. In order to compile and run the project, we will have to execute the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
$ cd output
$ make
$ ./bin/hello_world
```

The program will print the message “Hello, Real-Time World!” on the screen every second. To exit, it will be necessary to interrupt the execution of the program by entering the key combination `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
