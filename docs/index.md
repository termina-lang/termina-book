# The Termina Book

**Termina** is a domain-specific programming language for reactive, real-time
embedded software. It provides memory safety, bounded execution, and timing
analyzability as properties of the language itself, and it transpiles to
MISRA-compliant C that runs on RTEMS, FreeRTOS, and POSIX systems.

## A first taste

A Termina application is a set of components that react to events. The
following task class defines such a component, whose `timeout` action runs in
response to the events received on its timer port and prints a message:

```termina
task class CHelloWorldTask {

    timer_port : sink TimeVal triggers timeout;

    system_port : access SystemAPI;

    action timeout(&priv self, _current_time : TimeVal) -> Status<i32> {

        let msg : [char; 32] = "Hello, Real-Time World!";
        let ret : Status<i32> = Success;

        self->system_port.println(&msg);

        return ret;

    }

};
```

The chapter [Hello, Real-Time World!](started/hello-world.md) connects an
instance of this class to a periodic timer, so that the message prints once per
second, and then builds and runs the program step by step.

## How the book is organized

| Part | What it covers |
|:-----|:---------------|
| [Getting Started](started/install.md) | Installing the toolchain and running a first program. |
| [Building Our First Application](tutorial.md) | A guided tour: a complete on-board control application, from empty project to running system. |
| [Language Basics](basics/types.md) | Types, variables, expressions, control flow, functions, and references. |
| [The Reactive Model](reactive/overview.md) | Tasks, handlers, and resources: the components of a Termina system. |
| [Communication and Memory](comm/ports-and-channels.md) | Ports, channels, message passing, and deterministic memory management. |
| [Systems and Platforms](wiring/application-module.md) | Assembling the application module, writing device drivers with memory-mapped I/O, and the platforms and OSAL the system runs on. |
| [Tooling](tooling/project-structure.md) | Project layout, the build system, and debugging. |
| [Appendix](appendix/keywords.md) | Reference tables: keywords, operators, built-in types, conventions. |
