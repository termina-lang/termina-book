# Installation

The Termina to C transpiler is still in an early stage of development. Therefore, binary releases are not available. The only way is to compile the project from source. To do this, it is first necessary to install the Stack tool. The Stack installation instructions can be found through this [link](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/).

Once Stack is installed and the repository is cloned, it is necessary to execute the following commands from the terminal:

```bash
$ stack init
$ stack install
```

The first one will initialize the repository and generate the configuration files needed to compile the project. The second one allows you to compile the project and install the binary in a specific directory so that it is accessible for execution.

In order to execute the code generated by the transpiler, it is necessary to install the Termina runtime found in this [repository](https://github.com/termina-lang/termina-runtime).
